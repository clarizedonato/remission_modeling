# Remission Modeling
The code in this repo is meant to be run in MATLAB R2024b

In this code, a linear regression model is used to predict whether noddi isovf values are associated with treatment outcomes in individuals with treatment-resistant late-life depression.   
This code is a simple loop of a linear regression model. 

This repo will also include code for creating violin plots of brain region-specific fraction of isotropic diffusion (fISO) values in remission vs non-remission individuals. 
The code for the violin plots is based on daviolin plot package (https://github.com/povilaskarvelis/DataViz) 

Attached is an example of the violin plots made using this code.
